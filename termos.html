<h1>Terms of Service</h1>
<p>Last updated: <strong>September 28, 2025</strong></p>


<h2>1. About Mobile Pro League</h2>
<p>Mobile Pro League is a company that runs esports leagues and produces content for mobile games. We provide tools that let users connect their TikTok accounts to publish game highlights, clips, and promotional videos.</p>


<h2>2. Services</h2>
<p>We use TikTok Developer APIs (Login Kit, Content Posting API and Share Kit) to allow users to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in using TikTok (user.info.basic)</li>
<li>Upload videos as drafts to their TikTok account (video.upload)</li>
<li>Publish videos directly to their TikTok account (video.publish) — only after the user authorizes the action</li>
</ul>


<h2>3. User responsibilities</h2>
<p>Users must not post illegal content, spam, or content that violates TikTok rules. Mobile Pro League is not responsible for user-generated content. When you publish content using our service, you confirm you have the right to publish that content.</p>


<h2>4. Account and authorization</h2>
<p>To use publishing features you must authorize Mobile Pro League to access your TikTok account via the Login Kit. You can revoke access at any time in your TikTok account settings.</p>


<h2>5. Limitation of liability</h2>
<p>We provide the tools to integrate with TikTok. We are not responsible for TikTok outages, account suspensions or policy enforcement by TikTok. Use the service at your own risk.</p>


<h2>6. Changes</h2>
<p>We may change these Terms. We will post updates on this page with the date of revision.</p>
